## Project: Build a Digit Recognition Program

This is one of the projects I have realized as part of my Udacity Machine Learning nanodegree. It consists of three sections:

In the first part I Designed and implemented a deep learning model that learns to recognize sequences of digits. 
I trained the model using synthetic data generated by concatenating character images from notMNIST or MNIST. 




In the second part I trained the model against real data. In particular, the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is a good large-scale dataset collected from house numbers in Google Street View. Training on this more challenging dataset, where the digits are not neatly lined-up and have various skews, fonts and colors, likely means you have to do some hyperparameter exploration to perform well.


In the third part I took several pictures of numbers that I found around me (five), and run them through my classifier on my computer to produce example results.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html) (v0.17)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

In addition to the above, for those optionally seeking to use image processing software, you may need one of the following:
- [PyGame](http://pygame.org/)
   - Helpful links for installing PyGame:
   - [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
   - [PyGame Information](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/info)
   - [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pygame-mirror-on-google-groups)
   - [PyGame subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

For those optionally seeking to deploy an Android application:
- Android SDK & NDK (see this [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/README.md))

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. `pygame` and `OpenCV` can then be installed using one of the following commands:

Mac:  
```bash
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/quasiben pygame
conda install -c menpo opencv=2.4.11
```

Windows & Linux:  
```bash
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/tlatorre pygame
conda install -c menpo opencv=2.4.11
```

### Code

A template notebook is provided as `digit_recognition.ipynb`. While no code is included in the notebook, you will be required to use the notebook to implement the basic functionality of your project and answer questions about your implementation and results. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `digit_recognition/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook digit_recognition.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook digit_recognition.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and notebook file in your browser.


### Data

While no data is directly provided with the project, you will be required to download and use the [Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/), along with either the [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) or [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) datasets. If you've completed the course material, the **notMINIST** dataset should already be available.
